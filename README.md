##Overview
Frogger. My first front-end developement project to be completed on the General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Course. 

We were challenged over the course of a week to re-create a classic grid game. The game was to be completed individually in one week, rendered in the browser and created using vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML.  

##Brief
- Render a game in the browser
- Create a game using vanilla Javascript, HTML & CSS
- Design logic 
- Deploy the game online
